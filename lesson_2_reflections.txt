What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It creates a .git file in the directory, which is basically a kind of 
	file which enables us to make history of various versions of anything 
	that we are working upon. So, for that reason, it is important to 
	initialize a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	 It acts as an intermediate between two. It stores the file ready 
	 to be commited. It tells the git that these are the files that 
	 you should take care of, make history of, etc. I doesn't actually 
	 commits them. It is important as it separates the two thing and 
	 makes easy for us to manage our files.
